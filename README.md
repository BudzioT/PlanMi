# PlanMi

It's just a basic mobile app, my first one ever so I haven't had any other ideas. I just wanted to learn how to make mobile apps</br>
</br>
Currently only the calendar works from the main menu - the notes redirect to the today's day, but I want them to have a different function later. It has 3 layouts within itself and tasks from today are placed into the title screen too.</br>
Tasks and notes are saved, so even leaving the application keeps them safe.</br>
Making multiday events seems kinda broken, but I need a break from mobile apps lol, time to get back to games for some time
